# This is a configuration file template for the elan-to-latex script.
# The configuration file is used to specify the input and output files
# as well as some parameters that affect LaTeX formatting. 

# Specify input files here, each non-empty and non-commented line 
# between '/ELAN INPUT FILES' and '/OUTPUT FILE' is expected to contain 
# a filename or path. Include file extension (.eaf). You can comment 
# out any lines you do not want the program to read with '#'

/ELAN INPUT FILES
Haneshwar.ready.for.elan_new.eaf


# Specify the output file below. Include only one filename or path. The
# filename will serve as the LaTeX package name. The default filename
# is 'lingex' and the file will be created in the directory where the 
# script is run. The extension must be '.sty'.

# WARNING: The program does not check whether the file already exists 
# and will overwrite any file with that name, the user should make sure 
# the filename is available. 

/OUTPUT FILE
lingex.sty

# Below the user can specify options concerning the LaTeX formatting,
# for example list gloss elements that should appear in small caps. 
# Other options might be included in the future.
